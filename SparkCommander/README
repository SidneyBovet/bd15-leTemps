Sparkcommander:
===============

This application should be on the cluster and is submitted as a jar to Spark
by smargn.
To code in Sparkcommander:
 - Follow the instructions in ./smargn/README to add your technique. It involves
   modifying src/main/scala/SparkCommander.scala

 - use the command 'sbt assembly' in the folder SparkCommander/ to package and
   add all dependencies in the jar. Then upload to the cluster using SCP: 'scp
   <path to SparkCommander>/target/scala-2.10/SparkCommander-assembly-1.0.jar
   <your gaspar login>@icdataportal2:~'. Example for myself: 'scp
   ./target/scala-2.10/SparkCommander-assembly-1.0.jar rutz@icdataportal2:~'
   (When I am in the folder SparkCommander).

 - If you want to test only your technique without the Web Interface, create an
   SSH connection to icdataportal2, then use the command 'spark-submit --class
   SparkCommander --master yarn-client SparkCommander-assembly-1.0.jar <word>...
   -n technique_name <parameter>...' Where <word>... is a list of space
   separated words you want to search and <parameter> is a list of space
   separated doubles which are the parameters for this technique. If any error
   in the parameters of SparkCommander is made, it should print explanations on
   what are the parameters and how to put them in the command line (Thank you
   scopt: https://github.com/scopt/scopt).
   To get your results, use 'hadoop fs -<the command you want>
   /projects/temporal-profiles/results/<dash separated list of the
   words>_<technique name>_<dash separated list of the parameters as doubles>/
   results.txt'. The results are displayed as follows:
   <word> -> [list of similar words]
   <word> -> NOSIMILARWORDS
   <word> -> ERROR404
   We assume it to be trivial to understand the format.
   If you want to relaunch the same command twice, do not forget to rm -R the
   folder of your results being /project/temporal-profiles/results/<your folder>
   otherwise, it could happen that the program crashes since it should only be
   called when the results have never been computed before.

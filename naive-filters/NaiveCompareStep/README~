This is the first implementation of the NaiveCompare algorithm

To run it: 
- Put the data.csv into the input directory ($HADOOP_INPUT_DIRECTORY) you have on your cluster
- Go into SparkScalaNaiveCompare
- Do sbt package just to be sure you have the last compiled version
- erase your output directory on your cluster (hadoop fs -rm -r $HADOOP_OUPUT_DIRECTORY)
- lauch the spark job (spark-submit --class NaiveCompare --master yarn-client ./target/scala-2.10/sparkscalanaivecompare_2.10-1.0.jar $HADOOP_INPUT_DIRECTORY $HADOOP_OUPUT_DIRECTORY)
- you can check if the output is: "orange /n flower" (
hadoop fs -cat $HADOOP_OUPUT_DIRECTORY/*)

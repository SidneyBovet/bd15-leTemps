This is the Play application for the Big Data 2015 project: Smargn
==================================================================

When git pulled, run activator to install activator on your computer for Linux 
and use activator.bat for Windows.
It will resolve all dependencies, install activator and add it to your path.

To launch the project after installation, run "activator run" in your terminal
and when the project is live, go to your browser at the address localhost:9000.
You will see the Play autogenerated index. and go to /smargn to use it.

To add a technique T, check ../SparkCommander/ and follow the template in
technique.NaiveComparison.scala.
In project smargn:
 - Modify app/views/smargn.scala.html and add into the element #technique_selector
the child "<option><name of T></option>".
 - Modify public/javascripts/adapt_params.js and add a case for T to
specify its number of parameters.
In project Spark Commander:
 - Go to SparkCommander.scala and look for the function main.
 Add a "case <name of T> => ..." to be able to launch it from the browser.

All files of the technique must be in SparkCommander!! No technique should be in
smargn since it needs to be on the cluster to have a Spark Context.

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.
